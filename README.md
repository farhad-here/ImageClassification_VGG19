# 🖼️ Image Classification with VGG19

This project demonstrates how to perform image classification using the pre-trained **VGG19** model from Keras. It's a simple, clean example of transfer learning for identifying image content with high accuracy.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Uses VGG19 pretrained on ImageNet
- ✅ Loads and preprocesses custom images
- ✅ Outputs top predictions with class names and confidence scores
- ✅ Easy to customize for other datasets or models

---

## 🧰 Requirements

Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pillow
```

!download this:
```
vgg19_weights_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels_notop.h5
```
!this will be create in VGG.ipynb:
